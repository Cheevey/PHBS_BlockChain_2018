# Research on the application of blockchain in copyright - based on Unilimited IP	
## Introduction
### What is copyright?
At the beginning of the report, I will briefly introduce the main subject of the study: **intellectual property (IP)**. It is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect（"Understanding Industrial Property". World Intellectual Property Organization. Retrieved 2018-12-06.）. It mainly includes two parts, one is **industrial property** and the other is **copyright**. **Copyright** is a legal right, existing in many countries, that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights to determine whether, and under what conditions, this original work may be used by others. However I will focus on the IP application of the entertainment industry by analyzing copyright. So in this report, I will equate IP with copyright.
### Why can it be related with the blockchain?
Why does it seem that a centrally managed copyright will be related to the blockchain? According to [PWC's latest research](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/tmt/media/outlook.html), the blockchain has become the eight key technologies affecting the development of the entertainment industry.
