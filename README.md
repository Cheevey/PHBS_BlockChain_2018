# Research on the application of blockchain in copyright - based on Unilimited IP	
## Introduction
### What is copyright?
At the beginning of the report, I will briefly introduce the main subject of the study: **intellectual property (IP)**. It is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect（"Understanding Industrial Property". World Intellectual Property Organization.）. It mainly includes two parts, one is **industrial property** and the other is **copyright**. 

**Copyright** is a legal right, existing in many countries, that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights to determine whether, and under what conditions, this original work may be used by others. However I will focus on the IP application of the entertainment industry by analyzing copyright. So in this report, I will equate IP with copyright.

### Why can it be related with the blockchain?

Why does it seem that a centrally managed copyright will be related to the blockchain? According to [PWC's latest research](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/tmt/media/outlook.html), the blockchain has become the eight key technologies affecting the development of the entertainment industry.

		<em>key technologies affecting the development of the entertainment industry</em>


The characteristics of the blockchain have to be the crucial factor. Features are as follows: 
1. The blockchain enables peer-to-peer transactions, eliminating the need for transactional intermediaries and thus reducing transaction costs. 
2. Transaction settlement is almost real-time, which improves transaction efficiency and greatly improves asset utilization. 
3. The irreversible modification of information on the blockchain and the decentralized data storage method make it the best carrier for data records. 
4. Programmable blockchain automates the transaction process.

With the advent of the global digital age, the traditional publishing industry has shifted from paper to digital. The digital reading market and the online music market are all developing rapidly. It is foreseeable that in the near future, many copyrighted content will be digitally digitized versions of the network. Blockchain technology will bring the following three major changes to the current digital rights market:

*  Copyright protection

At present, there are a series of problems in the copyright field, such as difficulty in obtaining evidence, long cycle, and high cost. The blockchain has certain advantages in copyright registration and notarization. First, the openness of the blockchain allows anyone to write information to the blockchain at any time and any place. This makes copyright registration unrestricted by time and space, and the cost required by the conventional method is small. Furthermore, the information on the blockchain cannot be tampered with as soon as it is written. All copyright information is open and transparent, it is very convenient to consult and do "existence proof", which can effectively defend rights and prevent plagiarism.

* Copyright transaction

The current copyright purchases and transactions are mostly middleman trading models. The royalty needs to reach the copyright owner through IP agent brokers, distribution companies, copyright agents, platform service providers and so on. Through the blockchain to achieve copyright transactions on the chain, all transaction information can be tracked and queried, avoiding multiple authorizations, pricing confusion, fraud and so on. At the same time, it can directly connect the copyright buyers, and the peer-to-peer transaction method removes the high cost brought by the centralized platform, so that users and authors can obtain greater profits.

* Digital advertising is accurately placed

Based on the anonymity of blockchain technology and the transparency of information, it can obtain the public data information left by users on the network under the premise of protecting user privacy, and realize the accurate delivery of digital advertisements.

## The Market Value of Today's Entertainment Industry 

### The state of global growth of the entertainment industry

At present, the entertainment market is undergoing a new round of explosive growth along with technological innovation. According to *PwC's 2018-2022 Global Entertainment and Media Industry Outlook*, the global entertainment and media industry's revenue will achieve a compound annual growth rate of 4.4% over the next five years.  It will gradually break through the $200 million mark and rush to $250 million. The valuation of many companies related to the entertainment sector has gradually expanded with the market.

### Growth in representative countries

As we all know, the United States is the most powerful country in the global entertainment industry. From American dramas to Hollywood blockbusters to variety shows, the IP content of the US entertainment industry has long dominated the world. At the capital level, the US big entertainment industry is also a high-return “evergreen tree” with a long-term golden development period. IP in the US movie market, such as Marvel and DC, has brought a huge data flow and high commercial value, which has led to a high return on revenue. At the same time, from the research of *Tianfeng Securities*, as early as 2015, China has surpassed Japan and became the second largest market in terms of global entertainment revenue. It is easy to have a general understanding of the entire industry from the growth of the entertainment industry in China and the United States. (Data from [iResearch](https://data.iresearch.com.cn/home.shtml))

		<em>The growth of the entertainment industry in China and in US</em>
		
The emerging E&M market, for example China, has good prospects for future development. But compared with developed economies, China's entertainment industry is still in the early stages of development. In 2017, the GDP of China's  entertainment industry accounted for 4.4% of total GDP, while the United States accounted for 6.7%. As China's per capita GDP gradually increases, the Chinese entertainment industry will achieve explosive growth driven by the popularity of the Internet and the increasing awareness of IP copyright.Compared with the development level of the United States, the Chinese cultural and entertainment industry still has a large room for development. As the economic strength grows and the people's material level rises, the Chinese E&M industry will grow faster than the United States in the future.

### The driving force for the growth of the entertainment industry

In recent years, the growth of the entertainment industry has mainly been Internet + entertainment. From [China Industrial Information Network](http://www.chyxx.com/data/chuanmei/), it can be concluded that the market size of China's Internet pan-entertainment industry reached 409.88 billion in 2017, with an increase of 41.8% over the previous year.

		<em>The development of China's Internet entertainment industry</em>

On the online channel, there are many emerging industries with good profitability such as live broadcast, short video and so on. They have made an important contribution to the expansion of market space in the Internet entertainment market. It is expected that with the continuous transfer of user behavior in the future, online channels will become the main carrier of user entertainment.
Future Internet entertainment development will be promoted by the following reasons:

1) Online entertainment is more flexible and less affected by time and space;
2) The emergence of the Internet has created more new forms of entertainment, enriching people's entertainment experience;
3) Online entertainment can provide more personalized entertainment content through data analysis and other means to enhance the user experience;
4) Online entertainment gives users a wider creative space and richer entertainment content than offline entertainment with more limited content and form.

Through the above analysis, there are also reasons to believe that the current global entertainment market is extremely valuable and has a large investment space. The blockchain is becoming a new outlet for the entertainment industry through the rise of Internet entertainment.

## The disadvantages of today's entertainment industry

Today's entertainment industry has generated a lot of problems due to the over-interpretation of the IP market, including: authorization errors, plagiarism, pricing chaos and opaque transactions…

As an emerging country, China's problems are even more acute：

1) The problem of too long a production-to-output supply chain between the creator and the user is even more prominent. According to the data, online literary piracy has lost more than 10 billion in one year. Under the squeezing of pirated products, the annual revenue of China's music copyright party only accounts for about 2% of the total output value. This figure accounts for 70% and 90% of the developed countries such as Europe, America, Japan and South Korea, respectively, and the gap is huge compared with foreign countries.
2) The entertainment market is dominated by large enterprises such as Alibaba and Tencent. The centralized resource monopoly will make the quality content of small people covered, which will become the limit of future entertainment development.
3) IP is in the hands of a few: the excessive realization of fiery IP makes the buyer overstressed, and these economic pressures will eventually be transferred to consumers.

Combined with the characteristics and advantages of the blockchain, it can be believed that it will alleviate the chaos of the current entertainment industry to a certain extent, adding a strength to the rapid growth of the entertainment industry.

##  Blockchain + pan-entertainment industry

**Pan-entertainment**, originally referred to as the multi-field symbiosis of the Internet and mobile Internet, to create a fan economy of star IP. At its core is IP, which can be a story, a character, or anything else that a lot of users love.

Recently, the definition of pan-entertainment has been re-expanded. The cross-border of industries based in IP is essentially the cross-border of scene realization. Novels may be adapted into games. This game may have a show in the future. And fans probably bought this show ticket because of this IP, and bought a wealth management product based on this game in the exhibition area of the festival.

The essence of pan-entertainment is that IP content generates cultural transmission and economic realization in different scenarios through the time. The core of IP business value is diversified derivative operation, and finally achieves the purpose of realization.


![image](https://github.com/Cheevey/PHBS_BlockChain_2018/blob/master/images/5.png)

The current IP transactions basically have an intermediary and need to pay a large amount of commission to the middle market. At the same time, cross-border IP transactions have generated significant communication costs.

The rapid development of the Internet only enhances the speed and efficiency of global communication, but there is no way to achieve value transfer, and the blockchain can do this. The platform of the blockchain began to appear, mainly adopting the mode of entertainment IP + commercial trade + blockchain, and created the intelligent IP copyright intelligent trading market.

Therefore, the decentralization model came into being. It is very convenient for art workers to sell their own works. Buyers can also communicate directly with artists in one-to-one form. The copyright of works can be freely traded and freely distributed on the platform in the form of digital currency. Everyone can Become the holder of the copyright of the work!

The open and transparent trading procedure is actually more beneficial to the original authors at the waist and the tail to strive for the rights they deserve. After all, the head IP is a scarce resource that all platforms are robbing, and most of the waist and tail are sold together in a packaged form.  This is unfair and does not stimulate the enthusiasm of all creators.

Combined with the blockchain, the depth of IP transactions will increase, and art exchanges no longer require borders and intermediaries.

## What is UIP - Global Entertainment Copyright Trading Platform

### Bascic Introduction

**UnlimitedIP (UIP)** is an entertainment and intellectual property trading platform based on EOS. Utilizing the technology of blockchain and combining the EOS operating system's support for millions of commercial transactions, low latency and free of charge, UIP is committed to providing one-stop entertainment copyright services to global pan-entertainment IP holders.

### Current trading market

UIP is already trading on 6 exchanges. UIP tokens has a total number of 3 billion, with 1.5 billion for sale.
A total number of 1.5 billion UIP tokens will be released in the next few years and gradually unlocked on other trading exchanges. The remaining 1.5 billion tokens will be locked at least for 2 years. Among these, 500 million of the rest tokens will be used as the UIP layout recreational ecology community fund, and the remaining 1 billion as the UIP project development fund, which will be used for UIP copyright trading ecological construction, media blockchain industry and team expansion.（data from [UIP website](http://www.unlimitedip.io/)）

		<em> UIP basic trading information </em>

### Copyright form

Each IP meets the following requirements on the entertainment IP intelligent trading platform: (1) the first transaction occurs; (2) the transaction medium is based on the UIPtoken, and the exclusive “IPUnit” is generated, and the buyer chooses whether to sell the percentage through the trading platform. The percentage indicates the size of the equity held by IP. On the one hand, this kind of asset split can alleviate the huge economic pressure of the buyer. On the other hand, IPUnit is held by truly favorite shareholders. Good IP itself as a digital asset should also have a certain degree of sharing and collection value.

UIP will also log in to the Pan-Entertainment Expert Advisor. In addition to 100% of IP-derived content cross-selling, you can also hold shares in the derivative value of this IP.

		<em>Meisen Zhou</em>

Domestic famous political novelist, "in the name of the people" screenwriter *Meisen Zhou* has also reached a cooperation intention in UIP. Zhou expressed the hope that the implementation of UIP in the future can promote the healthy development of the entertainment industry.

### Platform resources & Strategic partners

The UIP team has a very broad range of resources in the Internet, including Tencent, Youku, and iQiyi.  Platforms are vital for publicity. Combining close ties with Internet platform, UIP will make it easier to get the market.

UIP has signed strategic partnership agreements with a number of companies, including Hengxin Culture, PressOne and the Egret era in the gaming industry.

Recently, the UIP team has reached strategic cooperation with many institutions such as INBlockchain, Taiyiyun Technology, Viking Capital, Digital Chain Technology and Canada CK, and will jointly build the world's first top blockchain IP exchange. They are excellent companies in the industry and have a good strategic relationship with UIP. At the same time they are completing a lot of related projects. These projects and UIP have opened up the upstream and downstream links of the entire entertainment content industry. From the generation of content copyright, the transaction circulation forms a complete industrial chain and an ecological industry circle.

### UIP Four-stage product application

* IP deposit:

UIP is easy to implement the digital IP of the user through the traceable, distributed, difficult to tamper and other characteristics of the blockchain itself, as well as the hashing algorithm, asymmetric encryption and timestamp.

When a user uploads each piece of work, it is automatically time stamped by the trading platform. At the same time, in order to prevent some lawless elements from plagiarizing others' success, and on the trading platform to seek profits through transactions, UIP will adopt the real-name system registration transaction mode, and carry out credit system for individuals.

**principle model**

![image](https://github.com/Cheevey/PHBS_BlockChain_2018/blob/master/images/11.png)

The user uploads the digital file that wants to be verified to the UIP system. The UIP will generate the user block and calculate its hash value. Then, UIP records the root hash value of the user block Merkle Tree to the anchor block. In the block of the chain; finally, the UIP broadcasts the root hash of the anchor block Merkle Tree through the transaction to the blockchain.

Through the above mechanism, UIP will minimize the cost of user deposits and ensure that the stored data is broadcast on the public chain, thus ensuring that its stored data is difficult to be tampered with by any individual or organization.

* IP transaction

When the seller generates trading demand, it will define its own IP type for sale according to the clear choice of the trading platform. Once the seller initiates a transaction request for the work uploaded by himself, the system will review and keep the seller's work confidential through the transaction committee of the autonomous community. When the seller uploads his or her legal artwork in accordance with the formal procedures. The system will match the system according to the needs of the buyer and seller. The buyer will filter the matched content and select the item he likes for the next transaction.

For some small and medium-sized IPs, when the buyer chooses to trade with the seller, both parties have the right to request an anonymous or non-anonymous transaction. For many medium and large IPs, they will not only be self-sustaining the IP source itself, but will also be extremely cautious about trading IP derivatives. The highest price is not the only transaction purpose. The buyer and the seller need to conduct multiple rounds of communication and collision, and even the seller must communicate with the buyer in the process of producing the derivative products. To ensure that the derivative works satisfy the seller's original imagination of the literary content. Therefore, large IP generally takes real-name transactions.

After the transaction is successful, the buyer has his own needs. A derivative of the purchased IP may be derivatized twice and linked to the trading platform to continue the sale, thereby alleviating the pressure on the flow of funds.


* IP separation

In the second point, I mainly mentioned trading the entire IP or IP derivatives. But when buyers and sellers need to split their own IP rights, they need to mention IPUnit. IPUnit's transaction uses UIPtoken as the basic transaction medium, that is, the buyer use the UIP platform, and the seller converts the IP copyright into its exclusive IPUnit and sends it to the buyer; the buyer and the seller must negotiate the IPUnit circulation and distribution ratio before the transaction; IPUnit is unique to its IP and cannot be universal. The buyer needs to hold at least 51% of its quantity to ensure the ownership. So fans can digitally collect their favorite work by holding IPUnit.

* IP share

When the purpose of the author's writing is to let more people accept the enlightenment of the content rather than profit, after authorisation and the self-governing committee review, the IP source can be shared.  When the IP assets are continuously split and one day reaches a certain "shared model" (any party's share of the holdings does not exceed 51%), then either party has the opportunity to use the asset (refer to the world famous book in the real world) Such as the copyright right has been opened, a certain percentage of IPUnit holders have the right to use.

### UIP business model
When an IP is initiated by a seller and the IPUnit is generated for the first time, a certain percentage of development costs will be charged. When IPUnit trades through a UIP token, a very small transaction fee is charged for each transaction.

The value of UIP token will increase with the IPUnit of a large number of IPs on the platform and the increase of IPUnit transactions. The application scenarios and transaction value of UIP will continue to expand.
