# Research on the application of blockchain in copyright - based on Unilimited IP	
## Introduction
### What is copyright?
At the beginning of the report, I will briefly introduce the main subject of the study: **intellectual property (IP)**. It is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect（"Understanding Industrial Property". World Intellectual Property Organization. Retrieved 2018-12-06.）. It mainly includes two parts, one is **industrial property** and the other is **copyright**. **Copyright** is a legal right, existing in many countries, that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights to determine whether, and under what conditions, this original work may be used by others. However I will focus on the IP application of the entertainment industry by analyzing copyright. So in this report, I will equate IP with copyright.
### Why can it be related with the blockchain?
Why does it seem that a centrally managed copyright will be related to the blockchain? According to [PWC's latest research](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/tmt/media/outlook.html), the blockchain has become the eight key technologies affecting the development of the entertainment industry.

The characteristics of the blockchain have to be the crucial factor. Features are as follows: 1. The blockchain enables peer-to-peer transactions, eliminating the need for transactional intermediaries and thus reducing transaction costs. 2. Transaction settlement is almost real-time, which improves transaction efficiency and greatly improves asset utilization. 3. The irreversible modification of information on the blockchain and the decentralized data storage method make it the best carrier for data records; 4. Programmable blockchain automates the transaction process.
With the advent of the global digital age, the traditional publishing industry has shifted from paper to digital. The digital reading market and the online music market are all developing rapidly. It is foreseeable that in the near future, many copyrighted content will be digitally digitized versions of the network. Blockchain technology will bring the following three major changes to the current digital rights market:
* (1) Copyright protection

At present, there are a series of problems in the copyright field, such as difficulty in obtaining evidence, long cycle, and high cost. The blockchain has certain advantages in copyright registration and notarization. First, the openness of the blockchain allows anyone to write information to the blockchain at any time and any place. This makes copyright registration unrestricted by time and space, and the cost required by the conventional method is small. Furthermore, the information on the blockchain cannot be tampered with as soon as it is written. All copyright information is open and transparent, it is very convenient to consult and do "existence proof", which can effectively defend rights and prevent plagiarism.
* (2) Copyright transaction

The current copyright purchases and transactions are mostly middleman trading models. The royalty needs to reach the copyright owner through IP agent brokers, distribution companies, copyright agents, platform service providers and so on. Through the blockchain to achieve copyright transactions on the chain, all transaction information can be tracked and queried, avoiding multiple authorizations, pricing confusion, fraud and so on. At the same time, it can directly connect the copyright buyers, and the peer-to-peer transaction method removes the high cost brought by the centralized platform, so that users and authors can obtain greater profits.
* (3) Digital advertising is accurately placed

Based on the anonymity of blockchain technology and the transparency of information, it can obtain the public data information left by users on the network under the premise of protecting user privacy, and realize the accurate delivery of digital advertisements.
