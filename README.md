# Research on the application of blockchain in copyright - based on Unilimited IP	
## Introduction
### What is copyright?
At the beginning of the report, I will briefly introduce the main subject of the study: **intellectual property (IP)**. It is a category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect（"Understanding Industrial Property". World Intellectual Property Organization.）. It mainly includes two parts, one is **industrial property** and the other is **copyright**. **Copyright** is a legal right, existing in many countries, that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights to determine whether, and under what conditions, this original work may be used by others. However I will focus on the IP application of the entertainment industry by analyzing copyright. So in this report, I will equate IP with copyright.
### Why can it be related with the blockchain?

Why does it seem that a centrally managed copyright will be related to the blockchain? According to [PWC's latest research](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/industries/tmt/media/outlook.html), the blockchain has become the eight key technologies affecting the development of the entertainment industry.

		<em>key technologies affecting the development of the entertainment industry</em>

The characteristics of the blockchain have to be the crucial factor. Features are as follows: 
1. The blockchain enables peer-to-peer transactions, eliminating the need for transactional intermediaries and thus reducing transaction costs. 
2. Transaction settlement is almost real-time, which improves transaction efficiency and greatly improves asset utilization. 
3. The irreversible modification of information on the blockchain and the decentralized data storage method make it the best carrier for data records. 
4. Programmable blockchain automates the transaction process.

With the advent of the global digital age, the traditional publishing industry has shifted from paper to digital. The digital reading market and the online music market are all developing rapidly. It is foreseeable that in the near future, many copyrighted content will be digitally digitized versions of the network. Blockchain technology will bring the following three major changes to the current digital rights market:
*  Copyright protection

At present, there are a series of problems in the copyright field, such as difficulty in obtaining evidence, long cycle, and high cost. The blockchain has certain advantages in copyright registration and notarization. First, the openness of the blockchain allows anyone to write information to the blockchain at any time and any place. This makes copyright registration unrestricted by time and space, and the cost required by the conventional method is small. Furthermore, the information on the blockchain cannot be tampered with as soon as it is written. All copyright information is open and transparent, it is very convenient to consult and do "existence proof", which can effectively defend rights and prevent plagiarism.
* Copyright transaction

The current copyright purchases and transactions are mostly middleman trading models. The royalty needs to reach the copyright owner through IP agent brokers, distribution companies, copyright agents, platform service providers and so on. Through the blockchain to achieve copyright transactions on the chain, all transaction information can be tracked and queried, avoiding multiple authorizations, pricing confusion, fraud and so on. At the same time, it can directly connect the copyright buyers, and the peer-to-peer transaction method removes the high cost brought by the centralized platform, so that users and authors can obtain greater profits.
* Digital advertising is accurately placed

Based on the anonymity of blockchain technology and the transparency of information, it can obtain the public data information left by users on the network under the premise of protecting user privacy, and realize the accurate delivery of digital advertisements.

##The Market Value of Today's Entertainment Industry 

###The state of global growth of the entertainment industry

At present, the entertainment market is undergoing a new round of explosive growth along with technological innovation. According to *PwC's 2018-2022 Global Entertainment and Media Industry Outlook*, the global entertainment and media industry's revenue will achieve a compound annual growth rate of 4.4% over the next five years.  It will gradually break through the $200 million mark and rush to $250 million. The valuation of many companies related to the entertainment sector has gradually expanded with the market.

###Growth in representative countries

As we all know, the United States is the most powerful country in the global entertainment industry. From American dramas to Hollywood blockbusters to variety shows, the IP content of the US entertainment industry has long dominated the world. At the capital level, the US big entertainment industry is also a high-return “evergreen tree” with a long-term golden development period. IP in the US movie market, such as Marvel and DC, has brought a huge data flow and high commercial value, which has led to a high return on revenue. At the same time, from the research of *Tianfeng Securities*, as early as 2015, China has surpassed Japan and became the second largest market in terms of global entertainment revenue. It is easy to have a general understanding of the entire industry from the growth of the entertainment industry in China and the United States.

		<em>The growth of the entertainment industry in China and in US</em>
		
The emerging E&M market, for example China, has good prospects for future development. But compared with developed economies, China's entertainment industry is still in the early stages of development. In 2017, the GDP of China's  entertainment industry accounted for 4.4% of total GDP, while the United States accounted for 6.7%. As China's per capita GDP gradually increases, the Chinese entertainment industry will achieve explosive growth driven by the popularity of the Internet and the increasing awareness of IP copyright.Compared with the development level of the United States, the Chinese cultural and entertainment industry still has a large room for development. As the economic strength grows and the people's material level rises, the Chinese E&M industry will grow faster than the United States in the future.

###The driving force for the growth of the entertainment industry
In recent years, the growth of the entertainment industry has mainly been Internet + entertainment. From [China Industrial Information Network](http://www.chyxx.com/data/chuanmei/), it can be concluded that the market size of China's Internet pan-entertainment industry reached 409.88 billion in 2017, with an increase of 41.8% over the previous year.

		<em>The development of China's Internet entertainment industry</em>

On the online channel, there are many emerging industries with good profitability such as live broadcast and short video. They have made an important contribution to the expansion of market space in the Internet entertainment market. It is expected that with the continuous transfer of user behavior in the future, online channels will become the main carrier of user entertainment functions.
Future Internet entertainment development will be promoted by the following reasons:

1) Online entertainment is more flexible and less affected by time and space;
2) The emergence of the Internet has created more new forms of entertainment, enriching people's entertainment experience;
3) Online entertainment can provide more personalized entertainment content through data analysis and other means to enhance the user experience;
4) Online entertainment gives users a wider creative space and richer entertainment content than offline entertainment with more limited content and form.
Through the above analysis, there are also reasons to believe that the current global entertainment market is extremely valuable and has a large investment space. The blockchain is in it, and it is becoming a new outlet for the entertainment industry through the rise of Internet entertainment.
